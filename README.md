# Web-Scraping-Challenge
Part 1 - mars_news.ipynb scrapes news headlines and preview text from https://redplanetscience.com/ and saves these to a new.json
Part 2 - mar_weather.ipynb scrapes weather data from https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html and stores information in a dataframe and csv file.
Screenshots_part_2 stores screenshots of estimated dates for midsummer and midwinter, which are then used to calculate the length of a Martian year in Earth days.
