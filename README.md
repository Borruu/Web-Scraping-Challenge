# Web-Scraping-Challenge
### Objective
**Deliverable 1:** Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Optionally export the data into a JSON file or a MongoDB database.

**Deliverable 2:** Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

### Solution
**Part 1** - `mars_news.ipynb` scrapes news headlines and preview text from https://redplanetscience.com/ and saves these to a new.json

**Part 2** - `mar_weather.ipynb` scrapes weather data from https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html and stores information in a dataframe and csv file. Analysis and findings are noted in markdown cells throughout notebook.

`Screenshots_part_2` stores screenshots of estimated dates for midsummer and midwinter, which are then used to calculate the length of a Martian year in Earth days.
